# MediaEval-2015-MLT

The MediaEval 2015 "verifying multimedia use" task aims to test automatic ways to classify viral social media content propagating fake images or presenting real images in a false context. After a high impact event has taken place, a lot of controversial information goes viral on social media and investigation needs to be carried out to debunk it and decide whether the shared multimedia represents real information. As there is lack of publicly accessible tools for assessing the veracity of user-generated content, the task intends to aid news professionals, such as journalists, to verify their sources and fulfil the goals of journalism that imposes a strict code of faithfulness to
reality and objectivity.

The task is to design/build algorithm(s) to classify social media posts within the MediaEval 2015 "verifying multimedia use" challenge dataset as 'real' or 'fake'.
